## Conversation (in progress)

### Turn 1
I'll read the technical design document and create comprehensive implementation and verification plans.

### Turn 2
Using Read to read /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/claude-agent.../design.md

### Turn 3
Using Glob to find '**/*.rs'

### Turn 4
Now let me examine the existing code structure to understand the current implementation:

### Turn 5
Using Read to read /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/claude-age.../messages.rs

### Turn 6
Using Read to read /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/claude-agent-.../query.rs

### Turn 7
Using Read to read /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/claude-a.../subprocess.rs

### Turn 8
Perfect! I have analyzed the technical design document and reviewed the existing codebase structure. Now I'll create comprehensive implementation and verification plans.

### Turn 9
Using Write to write /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust.../implementation-plan.md

### Turn 10
Using Write to write /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/c.../verification-plan.md

### Turn 11
Perfect! I have successfully created both comprehensive planning documents based on the technical design. Let me provide you with a summary of what was delivered:
