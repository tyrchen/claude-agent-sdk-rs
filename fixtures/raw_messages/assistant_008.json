It's the foundation of counting and represents a single unit or entity.\n\n**2 (Two)**\nThe smallest and only even prime number. It represents a pair or duality and is fundamental in binary systems.\n\n**3 (Three)**\nThe first odd prime number after 2. It forms the basis of triangles, the simplest polygon, and appears frequently in cultural contexts (e.g., \"third time's a charm\").\n\n**4 (Four)**\nThe first composite number and the smallest square number (2\u00b2). It represents stability in geometry (four sides of a square, four cardinal directions).\n\n**5 (Five)**\nA prime number that's central to our base-10 number system (half of 10). Humans have five fingers on each hand, which likely influenced our decimal counting system."
